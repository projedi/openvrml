/**
 * @page intro 1. Introduction
 *
 * The OpenVRML libraries provide an extensible run-time for rendering and
 * playing VRML and X3D.  OpenVRML includes two libraries:
 *
 * - @c libopenvrml, the core run-time for VRML97 and X3D worlds
 * - @c libopenvrml-gl, an OpenGL renderer
 *
 * @c libopenvrml provides the following functionality:
 *
 * - parsing interfaces for VRML97 and VRML-format X3D.
 * - a pluggable scripting engine interface for adding behavior to VRML/X3D
 *   via the @c Script node.
 * - a pluggable node component framework.
 *
 * @section license 1.1 Terms of use
 *
 * The runtime library (libopenvrml), including its associated headers,
 * including the VRML97 and Classic VRML X3D parsers, and the subordinate
 * OpenGL rendering library (libopenvrml-gl) are available for use under the
 * terms of the @ref lgpl, version 3.
 *
 * The associated test and example programs, the XEmbed control
 * (openvrml-xembed), the stand-alone player (openvrml-player), and the
 * Mozilla Gecko Web browser plug-in are available for use under the terms of
 * the @ref gpl, version 3.
