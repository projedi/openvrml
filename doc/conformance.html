  <H4>Some Notes</H4>
  A fair number of tests failed due to a couple of common problems.
  <UL>
  <LI>There is no sound support currently so any test involving audio fails.
  <LI>Text is not completely supported. There is only one font available in lookat so any tests involving text usually fail because a number of different fonts are needed for conformance.
  <LI>A weird problem I've been getting is with changing viewpoints. Whenever a vrml file attempts to change the viewpoint somehow(eg. using an anchor) instead of changing the viewpoint to the desired one, lookat instead attempts to load the viewpoint name in Netscape as a web address. (see test 8 of Anchor node for an example)</LI>
  </UL>
  There are currently no tests for the Script node, using Java or Javascript or even ECMAScript, available in the NIST tests. If anyone is aware  of any tests for the Script node could they inform me so that they can be added.
