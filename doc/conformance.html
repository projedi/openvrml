  <H4>Some Notes</H4>
  A fair number of tests failed due to a couple of common problems.
  <UL>
  <LI>Text is not completely supported. There is only one font available in lookat so any tests involving text usually fail because a number of different fonts are needed for conformance.
  <LI>PixelTexture nodes are being mapped the reverse of expected.
  <LI>A weird problem I've been getting is with changing viewpoints. Whenever a vrml file attempts to change the viewpoint somehow(eg. using an anchor) instead of changing the viewpoint to the desired one, lookat instead attempts to load the viewpoint name in Netscape as a web address. (see test 8 of Anchor node for an example)</LI>
  <LI>Lighting is incorrect on Extrusion nodes and causes a lot of failed tests as extrusions are used to test a lot of other nodes.</LI>
  </UL>
  There are currently no tests for the Script node, using Java or Javascript or even ECMAScript, available in the NIST tests. If anyone is aware  of any tests for the Script node could they inform me, s4vc@unb.ca, so that they can be added. Thanks.
