1. Run libtoolize:

$ libtoolize --automake


2. Run aclocal. You will need to tell it where to find the macros installed by
   libvrml97core and libvrml97gl. This is done with the '-I' switch. If you
   installed libvrml97core and libvrml97gl in the default location (/usr/local), the
   command is:

$ aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal


3. Run automake:

$ automake -a


4. Run autoconf

$ autoconf


5. Run the generated configure script:

$ ./configure


6. Build it:

$ make
