- There is a good deal of overlap between the helper functions imported from
  MathHelper.cpp and those in OpenGLEvent.cpp. As long as there's no good reason
  to expose these functions to the outside world, they should be consolidated
  and all the helper methods should be put in the unnamed namespace in
  ViewerOpenGL.cpp. OpenGLEvent.cpp, OpenGLEvent.h would then be eliminated from
  the build.

- glut dependency needs to be eliminated.
