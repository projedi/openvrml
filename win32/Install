1) For making LibVRML97 What else do I need?

  LibVRML97 requires zlib, libpng, libjpeg, OpenGL/Mesa, GLUT and antlr to build. 
 
    zlib:       <URL:ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/>
    libpng:     <URL:http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngcode.html>
    libjpeg:    <URL:http://www.ijg.org>
    Mesa:       <URL:http://www.mesa3d.org>
    GLUT:       <URL:http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/>
    antlr:      <URL:http://www.ANTLR.org>  

  Make sure you have java installed in your system.

2) How to build third party libraries?

   Use "nmake" utility provided by microsoft for making following static
   libraries. If you are having any problem to use "nmake", see bellow for
   information. 

 zlib.lib
         Use the command nmake /f .\msdos\Makefile.w32
         For building win32lookat and lookat, I have problem with 
         undefined symbol "errno" while linking. My simple solution is
         to add "int errno" in zutil.h and make the library.
         
 libpng.lib 
          Use the command nmake /f .\scripts\makefile.vcwin32

 libjpeg.lib 
          Use the command  nmake /f makefile.vc

 OpenGL/Mesa
          I have not tested with Mesa but I have used Opengl32.lib and
          Glu32.lib that comes along with Microsoft Visual C++6.0

 Glut32.lib
          Download directly GLUT headers and pre-compiled libraries for
          Microsoft Windows 95 and NT users (Glut32.dll, Glut32.lib 
          and gl\Glut.h).


antlr 2.7.0
           Antlr has two parts, a java program that generates C++ code, and a
           set of C++ utility classes. The utility classes are included with
           the CVS download, but you will need to download and install the
           antlr Java classes.  


3) Installation using MSVC++6


   You can install either by using Makefile.win or by MSVC++6
   Projects (*.dsp) and workspace file (*.dsw). It is recommended to use
   Makefile.win

  a) Using Makefile.win

   Use nmake utility provided by Microsoft. Before this you should see all
   executable files, include files and lib files of MSVC++6 are defined in 
   path, include and lib environment variables respectively.

   For example 
   SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\bin;c:\Program Files
   \Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MsDev98\bin;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
   \Common\Tools
   SET INCLUDE=c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\include;
   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\mfc\include
   SET LIB=c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\lib;
   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\mfc\\lib

   Give the command in command mode. Please note that you should be in 
   libvrml97\win32.

      i) nmake /F Makefile.win  
               for Help and options
     ii) nmake /F Makefile.win all 
               for making all libvrml97 and lookat executable. 

  b) Using MSVC++6 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) 

    MSVC++6 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) are included for libvrml97core, libvrml97gl
    and lookat. Workspace file for all libvrml97 is kept in libvrml97\win32. From here
    you can build whole libvrml97 (libvrml97core and libvrml97gl).
    From here for building libvrml97core, you need to set Project->Set Active Project->
    libvrml97core and for libvrml97gl, you set Project->Set Active Project->
    libvrml97gl.

    Individual workspace file for libvrml97core is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32 and for
    libvrml97gl is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97gl\win32.

    For building libvrml97core and libvrml97gl library, you need to set include directories
    GLUT, PNG, Zlib and JPEG library by Tools->Options->Directories in MSVC++6.

    For building libvrml97core you have to perform Custom Build Step for antlr.g 
    by Project->Settings->libvrml97core->Source File in MSVC++6. Replace c:\User\jdk1.2.2\bin
    with the location of java compiler. Make sure to set the CLASSPATH to include the directory that
    antlr is installed in. Replace c:\User\antlr-2.7.0 with the location "antlr"
    directory. Otherwise you edit the file libvrml97core.dsp in 
    libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32 and do the same. 

    For building only javascript dll library (libjavascript.lib and libjavascript.dll),
    workspace file  libvrml97js.dsw is given in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32\javascript directory.
    
    For building only antlr library (libantlr.lib), workspace file libantlr.dsw is
    given in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32\antlr.

    For building lookat application program, you need to set include directories 
    libvrml97core and libvrml97gl (for example c:\libvrml97\libvrml97core\src) and library 
    directories for libvrml97core, libvrml97gl, GLUT, PNG, Zlib and JPEG library by 
    Tools->Options->Directories in MSVC++6.

    Please note that I have faced undefined sysmbols problems while building
    lookat at debug mode. It is recommended to make lookat and all libraries
    (libvrml97core.lib and libvrml97gl.lib) under release mode. For win32lookat 
    no such problem exist. You can build either in debug mode or in release
    mode but not in mixed mode.

4) To execute lookat viewer

   a) If you use Makefile.win
       cd libvrml97\lookat\win32\bin 
       lookat ..\..\..\models\orbit3.wrl

   b) If you use Projects and workspace
      cd libvrml97\lookat\win32\release (In release mode)
        You may need to copy libjavascript.dll (In libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32\
        javascript\Release) and glut32.dll here or these files
        may be copied into system area (for example c:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 for NT). 
      lookat ..\..\..\models\orbit3.wrl
