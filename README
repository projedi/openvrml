About
=====

   OpenVRML is a portable C++ class library for reading and displaying
VRML97 files.  This distribution includes LookAt, a sample viewer
program that uses GLUT.

Dependencies
============

   If your system is missing any of OpenVRML's dependencies, first
check to see if they are provided by your operating system vendor.
If not, consult the URIs below.

     zlib                   <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/index.html>
     libpng                 <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>
     libjpeg                <http://www.ijg.org>
     FreeType               <http://freetype.org>
     Fontconfig             <http://fontconfig.org>
     Mozilla                <http://mozilla.org>
     Java Development Kit   <http://java.sun.com/j2se/>
     OpenGL/Mesa            <http://mesa3d.org>
     GLUT                   <http://opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut/index.html>
     Doxygen                <http://doxygen.org>

   OpenVRML can be built with reduced functionality to avoid many of
these dependencies.  See the following section, "configure options",
for details.

   Most of OpenVRML's dependencies are either commonplace or easy to
obtain for POSIX systems.  Windows users may encounter additional
difficulty compiling some of these dependencies, so compiled versions
are provided for convenience:
     <http://openvrml.org/dist/win32_required_libs_and_includes.zip>


configure options
=================

   OpenVRML's build configuration script accepts a number of arguments
that modify what features are built and/or what packages OpenVRML
depends on.

 --disable-gzip
     Disable support for gzipped VRML worlds. By default, OpenVRML uses
     zlib to read gzipped worlds.

 --disable-imagetexture-node
     Disable support for the ImageTexture node.  The node is still
     parsed, and events to and from it are processed; but no textures
     are rendered.  By default OpenVRML uses libpng and libjpeg to read
     get ImageTexture data.

 --disable-text-node
     Disable support for the Text node.  The node is still parsed, and
     events to and from it are processed; but no text is rendered.  By
     default OpenVRML uses Fontconfig for font discovery and FreeType to
     get font data.

 --disable-script-node-javascript
     Disable support for JavaScript in the Script node.  By default,
     OpenVRML uses the Mozilla JavaScript library to execute JavaScript.

 --enable-script-node-java
     Enable support for Java in the Script node using the Java
     Development Kit.  OpenVRML does not include Script node Java
     support by default.

 --disable-api-docs
     Do not build the API documentation.  By default, OpenVRML uses
     doxygen to build API documentation.

 --disable-gl-renderer
     Do not build the GL renderer.  OpenVRML's GL renderer depends on
     OpenGL/Mesa and GLUT.

 --disable-lookat
     Do not build lookat.  lookat depends on GLUT.

 --with-x
     Passing the argument "--without-x" to "configure" will allow
     OpenVRML to be built without depending on the X Windowing System.
     This option is really only useful when building OpenVRML on Cygwin,
     where there are OpenGL implementations available for both X and the
     Windows GDI.

 --with-jdk=JDKHOME
     By default the configure script uses the standard include and
     library paths when testing for the JDK.  Use this argument to
     tell the configure script to use a JDK in a specific directory.

        As of the 1.4.1 release, the Sun distribution of the JDK is
     rather badly broken for many recent GNU/Linux distributions.  The
     native code libraries in the Sun distribution have been built with
     an obsolete variant of the gcc compiler that is not binary-
     compatible with the compilers used in these GNU/Linux
     distributions.  If you build OpenVRML using the Sun JDK in this
     situation, the resulting code tends to crash at the first
     dynamic_cast that is encountered.


Installation
============

   Refer to the file INSTALL for detailed installation instructions.


Conformance
===========

   OpenVRML aspires to full conformance to the VRML97 specification. It
isn't there yet, but much of the spec is supported, and OpenVRML will
continue to get better.


Bug reports
===========

   Please report any bugs you encounter via the SourceForge bug tracking
system:

     <http://sf.net/bugs/?group_id=7151>

   Note that you will need to log into SourceForge before reporting a
bug.


Mailing lists
=============

   Two mailing lists are maintained:

 * <openvrml-announce@sourceforge.net> is a low-traffic list for
   announcments, typically regarding new releases.  Subscription
   instructions are at
     <http://lists.sf.net/mailman/listinfo/openvrml-announce>

 * <openvrml-develop@sourceforge.net> is a forum for developers using
   and working on the libraries.  User feedback is welcome in this
   channel.  Subscription instructions are at
     <http://lists.sf.net/mailman/listinfo/openvrml-develop>


Get involved
============

   We're always grateful for help in improving OpenVRML.  Consult the
SourceForge Task Manager for a list of planned improvements:

     <http://sf.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=2579&group_id=7151&func=browse>

   Unassigned tasks are up for grabs, but please post to the
openvrml-develop mailing list to alert others of your intention to take
a task.  This helps avoid duplicated effort.  If you do not see the task
you'd like to pursue listed in the Task Manager, but you think the
library could benefit from your contribution, post a proposal to the
openvrml-develop mailing list.
