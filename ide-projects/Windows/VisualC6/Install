You need to install Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 or later. If you 
want to use nmake utility that came with it, make sure that you have 
set up the compiler using vcvars32.bat script that came with it.

1) For making OpenVRML What else do I need?

  OpenVRML requires zlib, OpenGL/Mesa, GLUT, libpng (optional),
  libjpeg (optional), mozilla javascript (optional), Sun java 
  SDK (optional)and antlr(optional) to build. 
 
    zlib:     <http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/>
    libpng:   <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>
    libjpeg:  <http://www.ijg.org>
    js32:     <http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/>
    jvm:      <http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2>
    Mesa:     <http://www.mesa3d.org>
    GLUT:     <http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/> 
    antlr:    <http://www.ANTLR.org>  
 
  If you want to have PNG image support (libpng.lib), JPEG image support
  (libjpeg.lib), javascript support (js32.lib and js32.dll) and java
  support (jvm.lib and jvm.dll), make sure that all these libraries are 
  installed in your system. By default OpenVRML library is configured 
  with all these support.

  If you use "nmake" utility to make this library, then you have options
  to select all these support selectively.

  If you want to generate C++ code from antlr grammar(Vrml97Parser.g), 
  make sure you have java and antlr installed in your system. Otherwise generated
  code (Vrml97Parser.cpp) will be used for making the library and for this 
  purpose you don't need to download antlr and also you don't need to have
  java. The generated code "Vrml97Parser.cpp" is included with the 
  distribution. By default generated code is used to make library.
 
  If you use "nmake" utility to make this library, then you have an option
  to generate C++ code from antlr grammar or to use generated code directly.


2) How to build other libraries?

   Use "nmake" utility provided by microsoft for making following static
   libraries. If you are having any problem to use "nmake", see bellow for
   information. 

 zlib.lib
         Use the command nmake /f .\msdos\Makefile.w32
         For building win32lookat and lookat, I have problem with 
         undefined symbol "errno" while linking. My simple solution is
         to add "int errno" in zutil.h and make the library.
         
 libpng.lib 
          Use the command nmake /f .\scripts\makefile.vcwin32

 libjpeg.lib 
          Use the command  nmake /f makefile.vc

 js32.lib and js32.dll
          Use the command nmake /f js.mak

 jvm.lib and jvm.dll
          Download directly compressed file. It contains headers and
          precompiled libs.

 OpenGL/Mesa
          I have not tested with Mesa but I have used Opengl32.lib and
          Glu32.lib that comes along with Microsoft Visual C++6.0

 Glut32.lib
          Download directly GLUT headers and pre-compiled libraries for
          Microsoft Windows 95 and NT users (Glut32.dll, Glut32.lib 
          and gl\Glut.h).


antlr 2.7.0
          Antlr has two parts, a java program that generates C++ code, and a
          set of C++ utility classes. The utility classes are included with
          the CVS download, but you will need to download and install the
          antlr Java classes if you want to generate C++ code from grammar.  


3) Installation using MSVC++6


   You can install either by using Makefile.vc6 or by MSVC++6
   Projects (*.dsp) and workspace file (*.dsw). It is recommended to use
   Makefile.vc6

  a) Using Makefile.vc6

   Use nmake utility provided by Microsoft. Before this you should see all
   executable files, include files and lib files of MSVC++6 are defined in 
   path, include and lib environment variables respectively or execute
   vcvars32.bat script that came with MSVC++.

   For example 
   SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\bin;c:\Program Files
   \Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MsDev98\bin;c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
   \Common\Tools
   SET INCLUDE=c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\include;
   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\mfc\include
   SET LIB=c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\lib;
   c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Vc98\mfc\\lib

   Give the command in command mode. Please note that you should be in 
   openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6.

      i) nmake /F Makefile.vc6 
               for Help and options
     ii) nmake /F Makefile.vc6 all 
               to build the OpenVRML dll library and the Lookat program 
         using OpenVRML dll.
       By default it will make OpenVRML dynamic library with mozilla 
   javascript,JNI,JPEG image and PNG image support. Options are there to 
   support all these selectively by undefine the corresponding macro in
   `ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\winconfig.h`

       For example if you don't want javascript support in OpenVRML 
   library, then edit `winconfig.h` in `ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6`
   by undefine the macro OPENVRML_HAVE_SPIDERMONKEY and give the command
         nmake /F Makefile.vc6 WITH_JAVASCRIPT=NO all

  b) Using MSVC++6 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) 

    MSVC++6 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) are included for
    openvrml and lookat. Workspace file for all openvrml is kept in 
    'openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6'. From here you can build 
    whole openvrml (openvrml.lib, openvrml.dll and libantlr).
    From here for building openvrml, you need to set Project->
    Set Active Project->openvrml and for lookat executable, you 
    set Project->Set Active Project->lookat.

    Remember to set the include and library directories to point to 
    where you've installed OpenVRML's dependencies. You can have options
    to support javascript,JNI,JPEG image and PNG image support selectively.
    By default all these are supported. If you don't want to support all 
    these selectively then edit the file `ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6
    \winconfig.h` and undefine the corresponding macro. Macros for 
    javascript is OPENVRML_HAVE_SPIDERMONKEY, for java is OPENVRML_HAVE_
    JNI, for JPEG image support is OPENVRML_HAVE_LIBJPEG and for PNG 
    image support is OPENVRML_HAVE_LIBPNG.
    Set include directories and library directories for GLUT, Zlib, 
    mozilla javascript (optional), java SDK (optional), PNG image 
    support (optional) and JPEG image support (optional) library 
    by Tools->Options->Directories in MSVC++6.

    Individual workspace file for openvrmlcore is kept in 'openvrml\
    ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\openvrml-core' and for openvrmlgl is 
    kept in 'openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\openvrml-gl'.

    For building only antlr library (libantlr.lib), workspace file libantlr.dsw is
    given in 'openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\tplib\antlr'.


4) To execute lookat viewer

   a) If you use Makefile.vc6
       cd openvrml\ide-project\Windows\VisualC6\lookat\bin 
       lookat ..\..\..\..\..\models\orbit3.wrl

   b) If you use Projects and workspace
        cd openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\lookat\Release (In release mode)
        You may need to copy openvrml.dll (openvrml\ide-projects\Windows\VisualC6\
        \Release), js32.dll, jvm.dll and glut32.dll here or these files
        may be copied into system area (for example c:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 for NT). 
        lookat ..\..\..\..\..\models\orbit3.wrl
