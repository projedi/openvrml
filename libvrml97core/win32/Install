Installation using MSVC++5

MSVC++5 Projects (*.dsp) and workspace files (*.dsw) are included for libvrml97core and libvrml97gl.
Workspace file for libvrml97core is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32 and for
libvrml97gl is kept in libvrml97\libvrml97gl\win32.

For building libvrml97core and libvrml97gl library, you need to set include directories
GLUT, PNG, Zlib and JPEG library by Tools->Options->Directories in MSVC++5.

For building libvrml97core you have to perform Custom Build Step for lexer.lpp and parser.ypp
by Project->Settings->libvrml97core->Source File in MSVC++5. Replace c:\bison with the location
of "bison" (bison is yacc equivalent for windows) directory. Replace c:\flex with the 
location of "flex" (flex is lex equivalent for windows) directory. Otherwise you edit 
the file libvrml97core.dsp in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32 and do the same. 

For building javascript dll library (javascript32.lib and javascript32.dll),workspace file 
javascript.dsw is given in libvrml97\libvrml97core\win32\javascript directory.
