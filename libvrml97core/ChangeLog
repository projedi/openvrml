        * Displaced lookat, xmlookat, and gtklookat to their own packages. This
          removed the files:
          
          lookat.cpp
          ViewerGlut.cpp
          ViewerGlut.h
          ViewerXt.cpp
          ViewerXt.h
          ViewerXm.h
          gtklookat.cpp
          ViewerGtk.cpp
          ViewerGtk.h
          gtkglarea.c
          gtkglarea.h
          gdkgl.c
          gdkgl.h
          
          This eliminated dependence on X, Motif, and GTK+ from the build.

        * Displaced ViewerOpenGL.* and OpenGLEvent.* to libvrml97gl, eliminating
          dependence on OpenGL and glut.

        * Removed ViewerHOOPS.* and HOOPSEvent.*. These could potentially be
          made into their own package and provide an alternative to the OpenGL
          renderer.
        
        * Displaced plugin to its own package.

        * Removed win32Lookat. This, too, belongs in its own package. But I'll
          leave the specifics of that package to the Win32 developers.
        
        * Removed the javascript subtree and added a newer version of libjs to
          src/vrml97/libjs, and incorporated it into the automake build.

        * Nuked the OLD directory. These build scripts certainly would need a
          good deal of reworking after the reorg I've done, and hopefully the
          use of automake means they are nolonger necessary. If anyone needs
          they can be found in an older tarball.
