2000-03-28  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Added a -notitle arg to lookat so xswallow works again.

2000-03-26  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Finished implementing getField for Nodes so Scripts
	  can access exposedFields.

	* Fixed the upside down textures on some IFSs.

2000-03-13    <chris@quiller.morley.com>

	* Put in S K Bose's Billboard code and the MathUtils
	  for the axis-aligned bbox culling.

	* Fixed the last reported crashes with the NIST tests
	  (invalid VrmlNamespace references by EXTERNPROTOs).

2000-03-11  Braden McDaniel  <braden@endoframe.com>

        * Named the render mode enumerant in Viewer;
          Viewer::getRenderMode() now returns RenderMode. Static type
          checking is cool.

2000-03-10  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Add a Viewpoints menu on the right mouse button.
	Navigation is so broken right now.

	* Define VrmlNodeNavigationInfo::getField.
	
	* Make createVrmlFromUrl a little more robust
	(don't crash if no valid vrml nodes are read).

2000-03-09  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Ensure that lighting is turned back on when rendering Appearance nodes,
	so not all geometry following a missing Material node is unlit (problem
	reported by Michael Louka).

2000-03-09  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Fix elevationGrid color/normal per vertex.

2000-03-08  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Don't attempt to render null strings. Duh.

2000-03-07  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>
        * Made Viewer's protected member functions computeCylinder,
          computeExtrusion, computeSphere, and computeView all static, as there
          seems no reason for them not to be.

2000-03-07  Chris Morley  <cmorley@vermontel.net>

	* Apply textures to cone and cylinder tops & bottoms.

2000-01-23  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * Patch from Stuart Anderson <anderson@metrolink.com> applied to lookat
          to correct floating point handling on FreeBSD.

2000-01-21  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * JavaScript 1.5 beta 1 has been added to the project and incorporated
          into the GNU build, replacing the Arbitrary CVS Snapshot that had been
          in use.

2000-01-19  S. K. Bose <bose@pavan.barc.ernet.in>

        * Incorporated additions in System.cpp to support "http" under windows 
	  and also replaced "System::" with "theSystem->" to support virtual 
          function-call mechanism.
 
2000-01-16  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * Submissions from S. K. Bose <bose@pavan.barc.ernet.in>: Added "std::"
          in a number of places where it was needed, as well as conditional
          inclusion of the file "winconfig.h" (which now resides in
          libvrml97core/win32) for the MS Visual C++ Windows build.

2000-01-03  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * In lbvrml97core, changed the toString() function in ScriptJS.cpp to
          use the standard, cross-platform means of freeing the buffer required
          by the ostrstream. Squashing #ifdefs gives me warm fuzzies.

1999-12-14  Michael N. Louka <michael.louka@hrp.no>

        * Now tests HAVE_SOUND in Audio::setURL() to check whether to load audio
          files. Previously audio files were (down)loaded even if HAVE_SOUND was
          not true.
          
        * Suppressed "couldn't read AudioClip from URL" error message in
          VrmlNodeAudioClip::update() if HAVE_SOUND is not true.

1999-12-03  Michael N. Louka <michael.louka@hrp.no>

        * Incorporated modifications to support Mac OS 8/9. This was mainly additions
          to System.cpp and Doc.cpp as well as some Macintosh specific header file
          inclusions and other minor modifications to other files.
          
        * Added CodeWarrior projects for Mac OS (in macos directories for lookat and
          libvrml97core).
          
        * Added HAVE_CONFIG_H checks to a number of files that were missing them.

        * Replaced output to stderr with output via theSystem in setURL() in Audio.cpp        

1999-11-21  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * Cleaned up some old #ifdefs in VrmlScene.cpp, Image.cpp, pngread.c,
          and jpgread.c that would have prevented images and gzipped files from
          working.

1999-10-19  Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>

        * Displaced lookat, xmlookat, and gtklookat to their own packages. This
          removed these files from libvrml97core:
          
          lookat.cpp
          ViewerGlut.cpp
          ViewerGlut.h
          ViewerXt.cpp
          ViewerXt.h
          ViewerXm.h
          gtklookat.cpp
          ViewerGtk.cpp
          ViewerGtk.h
          gtkglarea.c
          gtkglarea.h
          gdkgl.c
          gdkgl.h
          
          This eliminated dependence on X, Motif, and GTK+ from the build.

        * Displaced ViewerOpenGL.* and OpenGLEvent.* to libvrml97gl, eliminating
          dependence on OpenGL and glut.

        * Removed ViewerHOOPS.* and HOOPSEvent.*. These could potentially be
          made into their own package and provide an alternative to the OpenGL
          renderer.
        
        * Displaced plugin to its own package.

        * Removed win32Lookat. This, too, belongs in its own package. But I'll
          leave the specifics of that package to the Win32 developers.
        
        * Removed the javascript subtree and added a newer version of libjs to
          src/vrml97/libjs, and incorporated it into the automake build.

        * Nuked the OLD directory. These build scripts certainly would need a
          good deal of reworking after the reorg I've done, and hopefully the
          use of automake means they are nolonger necessary. If anyone needs
          they can be found in an older tarball.

1999-10-17  Braden N. McDaniel  <braden@endoframe.com>

        * OpenGL renderer displaced from libvrml97core and placed in
          libvrml97gl.

        * Helper functions from MathHelper.cpp in libvrml97core placed in an
          unnamed namespace in ViewerOpenGL.cpp.

	* OpenGLEvent.c renamed to OpenGLEvent.cpp
